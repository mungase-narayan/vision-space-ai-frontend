# Temporary Authentication Bypass Instructions

## What was changed:

### Auto-Login Implementation:
1. **src/components/dev/auto-login.jsx** - Created auto-login component with real credentials
2. **src/main.jsx** - Integrated auto-login component

**Note:** All authentication guards and logout functionality remain intact and functional.

## To re-enable manual authentication:

1. **Remove the auto-login component:**
   - Delete `src/components/dev/auto-login.jsx`
   - In `src/main.jsx`: Remove the AutoLogin import and wrapper component

That's it! All authentication guards and logout functionality are already restored and working normally.

## Current auto-login credentials:
```javascript
{
  email: "user@gmail.com",
  password: "password123"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Update the credentials in `src/components/dev/auto-login.jsx` with your actual test account credentials.

## Benefits of this approach:
- ✅ Uses real authentication with valid JWT tokens
- ✅ Backend API calls work properly and data is saved
- ✅ Full functionality testing without manual login
- ✅ No fake tokens or JWT errors
- ✅ Automatic login on app start

## Note:
- Make sure your test account exists in the backend
- Update credentials in the auto-login component if needed
- Remember to delete this file when you re-enable authentication
